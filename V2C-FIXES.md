# v2c Fixes Summary

## 3 Critical Bugs Fixed

### âœ… 1. Search Input Now Works Properly
**Problem:** Could only type one letter at a time (page re-rendered on every keystroke)  
**Fix:** Changed from `oninput` in HTML to event listener added after render
- Search box stays focused
- Type normally
- Results update smoothly

### âœ… 2. Problem-Based Search Now Matches Activities
**Problem:** Put pipe-separated text in search box but didn't match activities  
**Fix:** Fuzzy matching algorithm that:
- Matches partial names ("20 Questions" matches "20", "Questions", etc.)
- Matches numbers + words ("25min Sprints" matches "25", "Sprints")
- Shows matched activities immediately
- Displays friendly message: "Found 4 matching activities"

**Example:**
- Select: "Student struggles with homework"
- Shows: Weekly Planner, 25min Sprints, Priority Matrix, Now vs Most
- Toast: "Found 4 matching activities"

### âœ… 3. Activities Sorted by Academic Year
**Default order:** September â†’ July (not alphabetical!)
- September activities first
- October next
- ...through to July
- Matches how teachers think about curriculum
