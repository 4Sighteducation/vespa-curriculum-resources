# 🚀 TEST RIGHT NOW (Before GitHub)

## The Issue
Your page is blank because the GitHub CDN URLs don't work yet (files not pushed).

## The Solution
Test directly in Knack first, then push to GitHub!

## ⚡ Quick Test (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Open Knack Builder
1. Go to: https://builder.knack.com
2. Open your VESPA Academy app
3. Navigate to **Pages** → **CURRICULUM RESOURCES** (scene_1280)

### Step 2: Add JavaScript
1. Click the **JavaScript** tab for scene_1280
2. Open: `Resources/KNACK-SCENE-JAVASCRIPT.js`
3. **Copy the ENTIRE file**
4. **Paste** into the JavaScript tab
5. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Add CSS
1. Click the **CSS** tab for scene_1280  
2. Open: `Resources/KNACK-SCENE-CSS.css`
3. **Copy the ENTIRE file**
4. **Paste** into the CSS tab
5. Click **Save**

### Step 4: Test!
1. Navigate to: `https://vespaacademy.knack.com/vespa-academy#tutor-activities/`
2. **You should see 3 books!** 📚
3. Click a book → Alert shows (Page 2/3 need separate scenes)
4. Check browser console for "[Curriculum] Page 1 loaded" message

## ✅ What Should Happen

### Success Indicators:
- ✅ Three book cards appear
- ✅ Book images load
- ✅ Progress percentages show (may be 0% if no completions)
- ✅ Progress bars render
- ✅ Hover effects work
- ✅ Console shows: `[Curriculum] All components loaded - Ready!`
- ✅ Console shows: `[Curriculum] API loaded`
- ✅ Clicking book shows alert with book name

### In Browser Console:
```javascript
// These should all work:
console.log(window.CurriculumAPI); // Should show class
console.log(window.CurriculumShared); // Should show object
console.log(window.CURRICULUM_RESOURCES_CONFIG); // Should show config

// Test API:
const api = new CurriculumAPI(window.CURRICULUM_RESOURCES_CONFIG);
const books = await api.getBooks();
console.log('Books:', books); // Should show 3 books

// Test progress:
const progress = await api.calculateProgress('ALevel Mindset');
console.log('Progress:', progress); // Should show total/completed/percentage
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still Blank Page
**Check:**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for errors
3. Verify JavaScript and CSS were saved in Knack

### Issue: "CurriculumAPI is not defined"
**Cause:** JavaScript didn't load  
**Fix:** Refresh page, check JavaScript tab in Knack has the code

### Issue: Books Not Showing
**Check console:**
```javascript
// Run this in console:
const api = new CurriculumAPI({
    knackAppId: '5ee90912c38ae7001510c1a9',
    knackApiKey: '8f733aa5-dd35-4464-8348-64824d1f5f0d'
});

const books = await api.getBooks();
console.log('Books:', books);
// Should return array with 3 books
```

**If empty:**
- Check Object_56 in Knack has records
- Check field_1429 has book names
- Check field_1439 has image HTML

### Issue: No Progress Showing
**This is normal if:**
- You haven't completed any activities yet
- Object_59 has no records for your user

**Test with fake data:**
```javascript
// Manually set progress for testing
const grid = document.querySelector('#curriculum-books-grid');
const cards = grid.querySelectorAll('.book-card');
cards.forEach(card => {
    const progressBar = card.querySelector('.progress-bar-fill');
    const progressPct = card.querySelector('.progress-percentage');
    progressBar.style.width = '50%';
    progressPct.textContent = '50%';
});
```

## 📝 Current Status

### ✅ What Works Now:
- Book selection page (Page 1) - **READY TO TEST**
- API integration - **READY**
- Progress calculation - **READY**
- Styling - **READY**

### 🚧 What's Coming Next:
- Page 2: Activity Browser - Needs separate scene
- Page 3: Activity Viewer - Needs separate scene
- Full navigation flow

---

## 🎯 Once This Works

### Next Steps:
1. ✅ Verify books load and display correctly
2. ✅ Verify progress shows correctly
3. ✅ Push all code to GitHub
4. ✅ Update KnackAppLoader to use CDN URLs (already done!)
5. ✅ Remove scene-level JavaScript/CSS (use CDN instead)
6. ✅ Build Pages 2 and 3 in new scenes

---

## 💡 Why This Approach?

**Testing locally in Knack first:**
- ✅ No GitHub/CDN delays
- ✅ Instant feedback
- ✅ Easy debugging
- ✅ Prove it works before deploying

**Then move to GitHub:**
- ✅ Version control
- ✅ CDN delivery
- ✅ Easy updates
- ✅ Professional deployment

---

## 🔥 After Testing

When books load successfully:

1. **Keep the scene-level code** as backup
2. **Also push to GitHub** for CDN deployment
3. **Choose which to use:**
   - Scene-level = Faster to update (edit in Knack)
   - CDN = Better performance (cached globally)

Both work! Your choice! 

**Recommended:** Use CDN for production, scene-level for testing.
