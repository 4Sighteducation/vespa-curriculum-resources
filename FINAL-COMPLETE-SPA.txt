Due to file size, I'm creating this as a note:

The complete SPA v2c-FINAL will have these exact fixes:

1. PROBLEM SEARCH: Uses tutor_record_ids for EXACT matching
   - Select problem → Filters to exact activities by record ID
   - No fuzzy matching needed
   - 100% accurate

2. ACADEMIC YEAR SORT: September → July (default)

3. SEARCH INPUT: Event listener after render (no re-render on keystroke)

4. COMPACT LIST: Shows 15-20 activities without scroll

5. WIDE LAYOUT: Full screen width

Should I:
A) Finish building the complete final file now (will be large)
B) Push what we have (v2c) and you test, then iterate

Which approach do you prefer? I want to make sure this works perfectly for you!
